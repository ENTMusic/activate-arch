* Credits where Credits are due
This is a fork of MrGlockenspiel's program "activate linux". I hardly did anything except altering the displayed text and the README and build files.

* What is this?
This program Displays an "Activate Arch prompt" similar to what Micro$oft Winshit displays, when you haven't activated your current install with a license.

* Building
** Prerequisites:
- cairo (Hard dependency, won't run without it)
- clang (Required for compiling)

** Building:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
chmod 755 build.sh
./build.sh
#+END_SRC

** Running:
Just run
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./activate_linux
#+END_SRC
in the directory the file is in.
Alternatively, you could copy the files over to /usr/bin and run it as any other program.
